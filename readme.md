# ![](https://github.com/devlooped/gh-chat/raw/main/assets/img/gh-chat.png) GitHub CLI Chat Extension

An extension to interact with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) using 
natural language.

## Installation

The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) must be installed first. 

Install:

```shell
gh extension install devlooped/gh-chat
```

Upgrade:

```shell

The extension uses the [GitHub CLI API](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api) to 
run queries and render them to the console.

interact with the GitHub API using natural language.
